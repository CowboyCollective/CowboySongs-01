In this album you'll find instrumentals as well as stems with and without effects. They are provided with the following goals in mind:

**1. To provide insight into the creative process.**<br>
Artists often release the finished product without showing us any of the behind the scenes. This can make the process of creation seem mysterious and difficult. By releasing all of the individual pieces, I hope that folks out there will see how a finished work is really a collection of smaller, easier steps.

**2. To help musicians make new music.**<br>
The unaltered recordings will be particularly useful to those musicians out there that need some source material for sample in their work.

**3. To help movie makers.**<br>
