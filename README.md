# Songs of the Cowboy Vol.01
Sharing, creating, collaborating, these are the values of the [Cowboy Collective](CowboyColective.cc). In accordance with these values, all marital related to the "Songs of the Cowboy" series is made available to you. These recording are under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license, which means you can use it in any of your projects, both personal and commercial, as long as you give the Cowboy Collective a little shout out for supporting you!

In this album you'll find instrumentals as well as stems with and without effects. They are provided with the following goals in mind:

**1. To provide insight into the creative process.**<br>
Artists often release the finished product without showing us any of the behind the scenes. This can make the process of creation seem mysterious and difficult. By releasing all of the individual pieces, I hope that folks out there will see how a finished work is really a collection of smaller, easier steps.

**2. To help musicians make new music.**<br>
The unaltered recordings will be particularly useful to those musicians out there that need some source material for sample in their work.

**3. To help movie makers.**<br>
Many of these songs would provide great background music for your latest short film. By providing stems with the effects, I hope that movie directors will be able to insert the music into their videos, and edit it to make a nice sounding soundtrack. 

Of course any and all uses for this material are encouraged. Want to throw a cowboy karaoke night? Want to use the sounds in your video game? Want to make new art the world has yet to see? All uses are welcome and encouraged. If you make something cool and new with this material be sure to submit it over at [CowboyColective.cc/submit](https://cowboycollective.cc/Submit)
